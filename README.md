>THE TALES OF WONDER! - Assembly Quiz Game

Welcome to **THE TALES OF WONDER!**, a fun and educational text-based math quiz game developed entirely in **x86 Assembly Language** (MASM/TASM compatible). This project demonstrates how low-level programming can be used to build interactive applications with game logic, score tracking, and input handling.

 >Description

**THE TALES OF WONDER!** is a level-based math game where players answer a series of arithmetic questions. Correct answers increase your score, coins, and lifeline; wrong answers decrease them. The game progresses through **5 levels**, each with a new challenge.

You’ll need to maintain:

* A strong score 📈
* Enough coins 🪙
* At least 4/5 lifeline ❤️

Make the right decisions and reach the final stage with a winning score!
